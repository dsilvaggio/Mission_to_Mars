# Mission_to_Mars
## Overview
  A script was created to gather data from the web about the mission to mars and store it in one convenient location. Once gathered, the data was displayed in one central location. The data collection was automated using web scraping techniques so that the data would not need to be collected manually. A final web app was produced that displays information on mars in a table, as well as full resolution images.    
## Scrape Mars Data and Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images/Titles
  Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, I was able to scrape the name of the most recent article, the article teaser, and the featured image from the "NASA Mars News" website. Since this website is frequently updated with new articles and images, the app will constantly be pulling the most recent data every time this script is run. I then directed my script to visit the Mars Facts website, and using the Panda's .read_html() function, I scraped the Mars- Earth comparison table and stored the data into a new DataFrame. Lastly, I directed my script to visit the Mars Hemispheres webpage and scraped the full-resolution images of Mar's Hemispheres along with the image titles. All of the above data was then stored in a Mongo Database titled "mars_app".    
## Update the Web App with Marsâ€™s Hemisphere Images and Titles
  I first downloaded my above scraping script from Jupyter Notebook into a python file. I created a scraping.py file inside the same directory and refactored the above scraping code to create four functions that scraped the above websites for the article data, facts, and images. I then added a scrape_all() function that runs all of the four functions and stores the results for each into a dictionary.
    I then created a flask app titled app.py. This app connects to a Mongo database, sets up our main HTML page, and scrapes new data using the above scraping.py code.
    Lastly, I created an HTML file and updated the code to display a title header and the data that I had scraped on one webpage. I implemented a button that performs our scrape and updates our web page with any new/updated data anytime it is pressed. A screenshot of the webpage can be seen below:
