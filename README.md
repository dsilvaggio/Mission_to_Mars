# Mission_to_Mars
## Overview
  A script was created to gather data about the mission to mars from the web and store it into one convenient location. Once gathered, the data was displayed in one central location. The data collection was automated using web scraping techniques so that the data did not need to be collected manually. A final web app was produced that displays information on mars in a table, as well as full resolution images.
